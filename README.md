Unfortunately, I can't directly upload files or create repositories on GitHub. However, I can guide you on how to set up a GitHub repository and create a README file for your project.

Here are the steps:

### 1. Set Up a GitHub Repository:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in or create a new account.
2. Click the "+" button in the top right corner, then select "New repository."
3. Fill in the repository name, add a description if you want, and choose public or private.
4. Initialize this repository with a README if you want to add the README file later. Click "Create repository."

### 2. Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine:

Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swetamishra123/profile-terribly-tales.git
cd  profile-terribly-tales
```

### 3. Copy  Code:

Copy and paste  `App.js`, `HomeScreen.js`, `App.css`, and any other relevant files into the local repository folder.

### 4. Create a README.md file:

Create a new file in your local repository called `README.md`. Open it with a text editor and add the necessary information.

### 5. Write the README:

```markdown
# React Instagram Profile App

This is a React web application that displays a simple Instagram-like profile page and home feed.

## Components

- `App.js`: Main entry point of the application.
- `HomeScreen.js`: React component for rendering the Instagram-like home feed.
- `App.css`: Stylesheet for the application.

## Libraries and Plugins

- `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `react-dom`: React package for working with the DOM.
- `react-scripts`: Set of scripts and configurations for React projects.
- `react-router-dom`: Declarative routing for React.js.

### 6. Commit and Push Changes:

In your terminal, use the following commands:

```

### 7. Update Repository on GitHub:

Refresh your GitHub repository page, and you should see your code and README file.
